Sir Charles Walker said the 90 minutes provided for the debate was \"just not good enough\" while Sir Bernard Jenkin warned that \"the prime minister cannot lead his parliamentary party unless he has their consent\".\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: \"We recognised that the government, in a pandemic, any government needs extraordinary powers available, and why with a heavy heart today, facing this highly unsatisfactory situation of an all or nothing motion, we will not be blocking its passage today.\"\n\nHowever, the Liberal Democrats have said they would vote against extending the Coronavirus Act because of the power it gave ministers to \"reduce rights\" for carers.\n\nDozens of Tory MPs backed an amendment to the motion by Sir Graham calling for future regulations affecting the whole of England only to be introduced if Parliament has the opportunity to debate and vote on them in advance.\n\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle did not select the amendment explaining that any amendment to the motion risked creating uncertainty about the legality of the Act, and potentially opened it up to court challenge.\n\nHowever he told MPs: \"The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory.\n\n\"All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House.\"\n\nHe said he was \"now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House not treat it with the contempt it has shown\".\n\nResponding to Sir Lindsay Hoyle's criticism, the prime minister's spokesman said the government was \"looking at further ways to involve parliament in the process in advance\"."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54362900", "published": "2020-09-30T16:08:08", "title": "Tighter Covid measures 'will take time' - PM", "text": "New measures to tackle the rise in coronavirus cases \"will take time to feed through\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\n\nHe said the high number of daily cases and \"tragic increase\" in deaths \"show why our plan is so essential\".\n\nThis breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

But analysts said Tuesday night's debate - the first of three - probably would not make much difference.\n\nWhat were the key moments?\n\nOverall, the 90-minute debate in Cleveland, Ohio, was light on serious policy discussion. Both candidates talked over each other but Mr Trump cut in some 73 times, according to a count by CBS News.\n\nThe tenor became clear early on as the two candidates sparred over healthcare. Hectoring from Mr Trump saw Mr Biden call the president a \"clown\".\n\nAs they moved on to the Supreme Court, the rancour continued, with Mr Biden refusing to answer when asked if he would try to expand the number of judges.\n\n\"Will you shut up, man?\" the Democratic candidate snapped at Mr Trump, later adding: \"Keep yapping, man.\"\n\nMr Trump, the Republican candidate seeking a second term, responded: \"The people understand, Joe. Forty-seven years [in politics], you've done nothing. They understand.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Biden: 'Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you?'\n\nIn one of the most talked about exchanges of the night, the president was asked by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, if he was prepared to condemn white supremacists.\n\nHe initially said he would but when asked to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group by name, he sidestepped.\n\nMr Trump said: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys, an anti-immigrant, all-male group, took to social media to celebrate. \"Standing down and standing by sir,\" it posted on Telegram.\n\nAntifa, short for \"anti-fascist\", is a loose affiliation of far-left activists that often clash with the far right at street protests.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Proud Boys, stand back and stand by' - Trump\n\nEarlier, Mr Biden said: \"This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division.\"\n\nIn other moments:\n\nMr Trump was asked if he would encourage his supporters to be peaceful if results of the election were unclear. \"I'm encouraging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully,\" he responded\n\nWhen Mr Trump said Mr Biden would be at the behest of the left of the Democratic Party over health and environmental policy, Mr Biden responded: \"I am the Democratic Party right now\"\n\nMr Trump defended his effort to swiftly fill a US Supreme Court seat to cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the bench, saying: \"We won the election and we have the right to do it\"\n\nThe president brought up the past drug use of Mr Biden's son, Hunter, who was discharged from the navy in 2014 for taking cocaine. Shouting over Mr Trump, Mr Biden said: \"My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it.\"\n\nReuters The debate in numbers 73 times How often Trump interrupted Biden\n\n43 minutes The amount of time in total Biden spoke for, compared to...\n\n38 minutes for President Trump\n\n20 minutesspent discussing coronavirus, the longest segment Source: CBS\n\nWhat did they say about coronavirus?\n\nMr Biden said Mr Trump had \"panicked\" over the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans.\n\n\"A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nMr Trump objected to Mr Biden using the word \"smart\".\n\n\"You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class,\" the president said. \"Don't ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word.\"\n\nLocal rules required everyone in the room to wear masks but of the president's family members present, only US First Lady Melania Trump donned a face covering during the debate.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Members of the Trump family were pictured wearing masks as they arrived, but removed them for the debate\n\nDue to the pandemic, the forum at Case Western Reserve University had a small, socially distanced audience and the traditional opening handshake was skipped.\n\nWho won the debate?\n\nIn a debate that was the political equivalent of a food fight, the winner is the man who emerged least covered in slop.\n\nOn Tuesday night, that man was Joe Biden - if only because his main goal was to prove to Americans that he could hold up under pressure, that he had not lost a step due to his advancing age. He had to show he could take a pie to the face, metaphorically speaking, and keep his cool.\n\nHe mostly met that standard, although it was at least in part because Donald Trump, by his constant hectoring and interruptions, seldom gave the former vice-president a chance to say something truly damaging to his own cause.\n\nTwitter Trump - the unconventional, bombastic, insulting and rumour-mongering aspect of this president - was on full display throughout the hour and a half event. Unfortunately for the president, many Americans, even his own supporters, find his social media persona one of his more unattractive attributes.\n\nTrump needed this debate to shake up a race that is tilting against him. Biden's lead has remained stable through turmoil on the streets and in the economy, and the Covid crisis.\n\nNothing about this hour-and-a-half free-for-all seems likely to alter the dynamics of this contest or change the minds of the one in 10 American voters who say they are still undecided (although perhaps they'll resolve never to watch another one of these).\n\nAnything resembling a substantive exchange was buried in a cavalcade of bloviation and bickering - and because of this, it was a missed opportunity for the president.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nAs is normal after a presidential debate, both the Trump and Biden camps have been claiming victory for their candidate.\n\n\"President Trump just turned in the greatest debate performance in presidential history, displaying a command of the facts and control of the conversation,\" said Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien in a statement.\n\nMr Biden's running mate, vice-presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, tweeted: \"We are in the battle for the soul of our nation, and the choice in this election was made crystal clear during tonight's debate.\"\n\nShe added: \"America was presented with a choice: a leader who offers a clear path forward vs. an angry, interrupting bully.\"\n\nIn other political reaction:\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who served on the president's \"debate prep team\", criticised Joe Biden's performance as \"shaky\" but also suggested the president had been overly aggressive, or \"too hot\"\n\nDavid Urban, a member of the Trump 2020 advisory committee, told CNN that \"this was not his best night by a long shot\" but said he succeeded in getting Mr Biden to \"act like Donald Trump a bit\" in terms of name-calling. He said President Trump could have condemned white supremacist groups \"more forcefully\"\n\nHillary Clinton said she was \"so proud of Joe Biden\"\n\nA snap viewer poll by CBS News, BBC News' US partner, named Joe Biden winner, with 48% backing him, compared to 41% for Mr Trump.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Debate moderator and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace struggled to keep order\n\nBut many commentators and newspapers said the real loser was the American people.\n\nOn the front page of its late edition, the New York Times said \"Trump's heckles\" had sent the debate \"into utter chaos\". CNN gave a similarly withering assessment, summarising the event as an \"absolutely awful debate\".\n\nAround the world, many media outlets described a chaotic, mud-slinging contest that painted the American political system in an ugly light."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54355673", "published": "2020-09-30T11:01:19", "title": "Berlin patient: First person cured of HIV, Timothy Ray Brown, dies", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the Berlin patient, pictured in 2012\n\nThe first person cured of HIV - Timothy Ray Brown - has died from cancer.\n\nMr Brown, who was also known as \"the Berlin patient\", was given a bone marrow transplant from a donor who was naturally resistant to HIV in 2007.\n\nIt meant he no longer needed anti-viral drugs and he remained free of the virus, which can lead to Aids, for the rest of his life.\n\nThe International Aids Society said Mr Brown gave the world hope that an HIV cure was possible.\n\nMr Brown, 54, who was born in the US, was diagnosed with HIV while he lived in Berlin in 1995. Then in 2007 he developed a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\nHis treatment involved destroying his bone marrow, which was producing the cancerous cells, and then having a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe transfer came from a donor that had a rare mutation in part of their DNA called the CCR5 gene.\n\nHIV resistance\n\nCCR5 is a set of genetic instructions that build the doorway that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) walks through to infect cells.\n\nMutations to CCR5 essentially lock the door and give people resistance to HIV.\n\nAfter the treatment, levels of HIV in Mr Brown's blood fell to undetectable levels and he no longer needed anti-retroviral therapy. He was in effect \"cured\".\n\nBut the leukaemia, that led to his HIV cure, returned earlier this year and spread to his brain and spinal cord.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that I announce that Timothy passed away... surrounded by myself and friends, after a five-month battle with leukaemia,\" his partner Tim Hoeffgen posted on Facebook.\n\nHe added: \"Tim committed his life's work to telling his story about his HIV cure and became an ambassador of hope.\"\n\nCloser to a cure?\n\nMr Brown's cure was too risky and aggressive to be used routinely - it remains principally a cancer treatment. The approach is also too expensive for the 38 million people, many in sub-Saharan Africa, thought to be living with an HIV infection.\n\nHowever, Mr Brown's story inspired scientists, patients and the world that a cure could eventually be found.\n\nThe International Aids Society (IAS) said it was mourning with \"a profoundly heavy heart\".\n\n\"We owe Timothy and his doctor, Gero Hutter, a great deal of gratitude for opening the door for scientists to explore the concept that a cure for HIV is possible,\" said Prof Adeeba Kamarulzaman, the IAS president said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe second person cured of HIV was announced earlier this year. Adam Castillejo - known as the London patient - had a similar treatment to Mr Brown and could come off his HIV drugs.\n\n\"Although the cases of Timothy and Adam are not a viable large-scale strategy for a cure, they do represent a critical moment in the search for an HIV cure,\" said Prof Sharon Lewin, the director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\"Timothy was a champion and advocate for keeping an HIV cure on the political and scientific agenda.\n\n\"It is the hope of the scientific community that one day we can honour his legacy with a safe, cost-effective and widely accessible strategy to achieve HIV remission and cure using gene editing or techniques that boost immune control.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-54356383", "published": "2020-09-30T11:37:35", "title": "County lines: Teenage drug dealers posed as key workers during lockdown", "text": "County lines: Teenage drug dealers posed as key workers during lockdown Published duration 4 hours ago Related Topics County lines drugs trade\n\nimage copyright Met Police image caption More than 200 people were arrested last week as part of the cross-country operation targeting county lines drug supplies\n\nTeenage county lines drug dealers posed as key workers during the coronavirus lockdown to evade police, London authority bosses have revealed.\n\nCity Hall's Rescue and Response's annual report found demand for drugs has been \"very high\" during lockdown.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were identified as being exploited to move drugs from London to 41 towns and cities across the UK.\n\nThe youngest age of a dealer was 10 and the oldest 26, the report has revealed.\n\nIn 2018, the Mayor of London pledged \u00a33m to the Rescue and Response programme and since then City Hall says more than 1,100 young Londoners have been referred for specialist support out of county lines drug dealing.\n\nmedia caption What is \"county lines\"?\n\nSadiq Khan said: \"It's vital we act now to protect children and young Londoners who we know are at increased risk of exploitation by County Lines during the pandemic.\n\n\"Criminal individuals and gangs are using the uncertainty created by Covid-19 to recruit disadvantaged young Londoners, many of whom have lost their jobs and in some cases their accommodation.\"\n\nBrighton, Cambridge, Southampton, Portsmouth and Basingstoke have been identified in the report as the top five areas targeted by London lines.\n\nimage copyright Met Police image caption The report found the average age of a dealer is is 15 to 17, with the youngest just ten and oldest 26.\n\n\"Young people were likely forced to work in the counties for longer and harder to meet the high demand, with some boroughs reporting longer missing episodes during lockdown,\" the report said.\n\n\"It is believed some young people were switched to working on local drug lines to meet the local demand, meaning they were less likely to trigger missing reporting despite continuing exploitation.\n\n\"Social care staffing levels were reduced during lockdown, and face to face engagement had to stop.\n\n\"This impacted the provision of support to young people during this time.\""}]}, "theguardian": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/sep/30/uk-coronavirus-live-news-updates-boris-johnson-warned-rule-of-law-at-risk-if-mps-dont-get-more-of-a-say-over-covid-rules", "published": "2020-09-30T16:12:26", "title": "UK coronavirus live: 'We will not hesitate to take further measures' if pandemic worsens, Johnson warns", "text": "What term do you want to search?

The move comes as the UK signed its first independent fishing deal for 40 years. The deal with Norway involves annual negotiations on share of catch, something the EU has rejected in Brexit trade talks.\n\nIreland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said during a visit to Washington on Tuesday night that he believed there was a good chance of a trade deal. \u201cThe obstacles are not insurmountable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be able to get this deal done.\u201d\n\nHowever, UK fisheries leaders warned the government not to sell them out.

The UK receives a fixed share based on how much stock its fishermen caught during a reference period between 1973 and 1978.\n\nUnder the new system proposed by the UK, the two sides would agree on what percentage of shared stocks are attached to each of their European economic zones each year. Catch quotas would be organised in line with that percentage.\n\nTimeline From Brefusal to Brexit: a history of Britain in the EU Show Hide After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK\u2019s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project. Brentry With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nReferendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the \"iron lady\" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand \u201cour own money back\u201d claiming for every \u00a32 contributed we get only \u00a31 back\u201d despite being one of the \u201cthree poorer\u201d members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in \u201cembryo\u201d. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was \u2018no, no, no\u2019 to what she saw as Delors\u2019 continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered \u201cUp yours Delors\u201d front page. Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of \u201ca single market without barriers \u2013 visible or invisible \u2013 giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prosperous people\".

France is particularly concerned by the impact on its fishing communities and has taken a \u201cmaximalist\u201d position that the status quo should be protected.\n\nWhile the policy would deliver the extra catches promised as a Brexit bonus, it is understood the government is also making new commitments on maintaining EU sustainability standards and cooperation on the collection of data.\n\nThe offer was part of five new draft negotiating documents submitted by the government, including legal texts on fisheries, the \u201clevel playing field\u201d, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, civil nuclear cooperation and social security coordination.\n\nAn EU official said: \u201cWe can confirm that we received additional documents from the UK. We are studying them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brussels sources, the UK\u2019s paper on state aid, still the most contentious of the outstanding issues, offered to lay out a series of \u201cprinciples\u201d on controlling domestic subsidies.\n\nThe EU said the paper offered hope that the UK would build on provisions in the recently signed UK-Japan deal. The trade deal with Tokyo prevents either side from indefinitely guaranteeing the debts of struggling companies or providing open-ended bailouts without approved restructuring plans.\n\nBut the paper failed to offer appropriate \u201cgovernance\u201d proposals that would allow Brussels to keep the UK to its pledges, EU sources said.\n\nThe EU wanted to ensure that any commitments were seen through and that in the event of a breach, parts of the trade deal could be immediately suspended.\n\nEU diplomats also said any agreement on such a method of regulating state aid would need to be taken \u201cat the highest level\u201d, as it would represent a significant divergence from Brussels\u2019 proposal.\n\nThe EU has pushed for the UK to accept the bloc\u2019s state aid rules, which do not allow unfair subsidies to be granted. The UK\u2019s position would instead offer recourse in the event of trade being distorted.\n\n\u201cThe UK-Japan deal is obviously now the basis but it isn\u2019t yet enough and we need to have bite,\u201d said one diplomatic source. A second source added that the proposal was as yet \u201cmore of the same\u201d but that it was hoped that the week\u2019s negotiation would flesh it out. \u201cThat is what matters,\u201d the source said."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/29/us-debate-trump-biden-latest-2020-presidential-news", "published": "2020-09-30T11:05:32", "title": "Trump plunges presidential debate into chaos as he repeatedly talks over Biden", "text": "The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden deteriorated into an ugly display of contempt on Tuesday night, as the president relentlessly interrupted and attacked his Democratic rival during clashes over the coronavirus pandemic, race, the economy and the future of the supreme court.\n\nOver the course of an extraordinarily combative and chaotic 90-minute performance, a fitting coda to what has been one of the nastiest presidential campaigns in recent memory, Trump interjected so frequently that Biden at one point lost his patience and snapped: \u201cWill you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\u201d\n\nWith just five weeks left until election day, Trump is trailing in national and battleground state polls. Amid accusations that he has mishandled the pandemic and damaging reports about his finances and past comments on the military, the debate was perhaps Trump\u2019s best opportunity yet to shift the dynamics of the race, which has been remarkable steady throughout an exceptional turbulent summer.\n\nDonald Trump refuses to condemn white supremacists at presidential debate Read more\n\nDominating the conversation appeared to be Trump\u2019s central strategy, but he did on occasion return to the themes he has pressed on the campaign trail.\n\nWhen Biden accused him of being the \u201cworst president America has ever had\u201d, Trump shot back that he had done \u201cmore in 47 months than you\u2019ve done in 47 years\u201d, an indictment of the former vice-president\u2019s long career in Washington.\n\nBut even as Trump attempted to pin Biden, he trampled his own message with a stunning refusal to condemn white nationalism and commit to a peaceful transition of power.\n\nPrompted by the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, to denounce white supremacist violence after two anti-racist activists were killed during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the president said \u201csure\u201d and asked which group he should condemn. Biden named the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group.\n\n\u201cProud Boys? Stand back and stand by,\u201d Trump said, before blaming the violence on the left. Social media users who identify as members of the group immediately celebrated the remark.\n\nPlay Video 1:16 Trump namechecks Proud Boys as he refuses to condemn white supremacists in debate \u2013 video\n\nTrump once again declined to honor the results of the election and continued to undermine the integrity of mail-in balloting, which is already under way in many states. Without evidence, he asserted that the process of voting by mail, which states have expanded in response to the pandemic, was rife with fraud.\n\nThe first debate took place in Cleveland, Ohio, against the backdrop of a nation in crisis: the pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 204,000 Americans and cost millions of jobs, while racial justice protests and climate-induced disasters demand urgent responses.\n\nIn a sign of the times, there was no public audience, handshakes were omitted, the podiums were staged a safe distance apart and empty seats separated the campaign staff and the candidate\u2019s family members in attendance. In a striking contrast, Biden\u2019s family and guests wore masks for the duration of the event, while the first lady, Melania Trump, and the rest of the president\u2019s family removed theirs after being seated.\n\nThe debate opened with a question on the supreme court, about Trump\u2019s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump defended his decision to advance the nomination just days after Ginsburg\u2019s death and just weeks before election day.\n\n\u201cWe won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her,\u201d he said.\n\nPlay Video 5:32 Voter suppression: how Trump is undermining the US election \u2013 video explainer\n\nRushing to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, McConnell shows power trumps principle | Robert Reich Read more\n\nBiden said Ginsburg\u2019s replacement should be chosen by the winner of this November\u2019s presidential election and warned that the confirmation of Barrett \u2013 whom he called a \u201cvery fine person\u201d \u2013 would lead to the gutting of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nTrump jumped in to accuse Biden of wanting to pave the way for \u201csocialist medicine\u201d and attempted to tie the former vice-president to his former Democratic presidential rival Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI beat Bernie Sanders,\u201d Biden snapped. Forcefully denying the accusation that he is under the control of his party\u2019s leftwing, he asserted: \u201cI am the Democratic party now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just lost the left,\u201d Trump quipped.\n\nBiden refused to directly answer a question about court-packing, an idea gaining traction on the left that would expand the number of supreme court justices to even out the political leanings of the bench, poised to have a 6-3 conservative majority if Barrett is confirmed.\n\nPressed on new revelations that he avoided paying any federal taxes for years and paid only $750 in 2016 and 2017, Trump claimed without evidence that he had paid \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d in federal taxes in those years, but he did not commit to releasing his returns as proof. He also bragged that he took advantage of tax loopholes and that as a successful businessman he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to pay taxes\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 2:59 Biden tells Trump 'you are the worst president America has ever had' in battle over taxes \u2013 video\n\nIn the hours before the debate, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, released their 2019 tax returns. According to the documents, the Bidens paid nearly $300,000 in taxes in 2019.\n\nIn a segment on the coronavirus crisis, Biden hammered Trump over his handling of the pandemic, in which the US has seen far more cases and deaths than any other country.\n\n\u201cDo you believe for a moment what he\u2019s telling you, in light of all the lies he\u2019s telling you, about Covid?\u201d Biden asked.\n\nTrump later cast doubt on evidence that humans are the primary driver of climate change and intensifying extreme weather, including record wildfires in the US west.\n\nDespite the array of topics discussed, the debate will probably be remembered for the unsparing insults. Biden called the president a clown, a liar and a racist. Trump said Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t have it in his blood\u201d to be a strong, decisive leader and claimed that his opponent avoided holding campaign ralliesbecause \u201cnobody would show up\u201d.\n\nTrump also tangled with the moderator, who struggled to keep the proceedings intelligible amid the crosstalk and interruptions. At one point, Wallace attempted to ask Trump why he hadn\u2019t released a healthcare plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Displeased with the query, Trump shot back: \u201cI guess I\u2019m debating you, not him, but that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:41 US presidential debate moderator Chris Wallace struggles to contain Trump \u2013 video\n\nTrump heckled, bullied and lied through the debate. It won't help him beat Biden | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nModerators of presidential debates typically do not factcheck the candidates, and Wallace made clear well in advance that he did not view that as his role. That left no one on stage to correct the president\u2019s misstatements, overstatements and falsehoods, which were plentiful. Biden, who was more truthful, employed a favorite catchphrase \u2013 \u201cHere\u2019s the deal\u201d \u2013 to try to set the record straight, but Trump\u2019s hectoring made a rebuttal difficult. On occasion, Biden just smiled and shook his head in amazement.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that everything he\u2019s said so far is simply a lie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he\u2019s a liar.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Trump raised unfounded accusations about Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, related to his business dealings in Ukraine. Trump was impeached for pushing government officials in Kiev to investigate the Biden family. Despite no evidence of wrongdoing, Republican allies of the president have continued to fixate on the manufactured controversy.\n\nBiden said the accusations were false and attempted to redirect the conversation back to the pandemic, but Trump refused to let it go.\n\nHe returned to the subject, reminding viewers of Hunter Biden\u2019s past drug use. Biden, looking directly into the camera, explained that like many Americans, his son had struggled with addiction.\n\n\u201cMy son had a drug problem\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s overtaken it. He\u2019s fixed it. He\u2019s worked on it. And I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:52 Trump interrupts Biden's tribute to late son to raise unfounded accusations \u2013 video\n\nAhead of the debate, Trump\u2019s allies attempted to cast Biden as incoherent and fanned baseless online conspiracy theories that Biden requires cue cards or an earpiece to answer questions.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign flatly denied the accusations.\n\nThe looming question is whether Tuesday night\u2019s performance will sway voters. While nearly three in four voters said they planned to watch the debate on Tuesday night, according to a recent Monmouth University poll, just 3% of voters said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d to affect their vote in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting hour and a half,\u201d Wallace said, with a chuckle that seemed to acknowledge his own understatement."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2020/sep/30/xi-jinping-to-address-world-leaders-at-un-biodiversity-summit-live-updates-aoe", "published": "2020-09-30T16:11:19", "title": "Beware human rights abuses in name of conservation, warns indigenous activist \u2013 live", "text": "13:44\n\nGood afternoon, I\u2019m Patrick Greenfield, a biodiversity and environment reporter at the Guardian.

Trump is a fighter, full of energy, full of piss and vinegar, eager to defend his record, and refuses to give an inch, and that\u2019s a virtue.\n\nMost of all, Trump got Biden to repudiate the Green New Deal (something Biden\u2019s own website says he supports), which will hurt him with the enthusiasts he needs on the left.\n\nHe got Biden to dismiss Bernie Sanders. Huge error. Huge.\n\nHe also got Biden to admit he\u2019s going to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I\u2019m going to eliminate those tax cuts.\u201d\n\nBiden said that last night, and that means your standard deduction and child tax credits that the Trump cuts nearly doubled will be slashed in half. So if you\u2019re married and your federal tax rate is, say 20 percent, you\u2019re going to pay 20 percent on about $12,000 in income you weren\u2019t under Trump\u2019s tax cuts. That\u2019s a $2400 tax increase. Just is.\n\nWithout any caveat last night, Biden straight up said he would repeal the Trump tax cuts.

OK, maybe not MOMENTS but seconds. It\u2019s reached the point where it just pathetic.\u201d\n\nThe Beetlejuice star has previously ripped President Trump\u2019s refugee policy.\n\nIn 2017, Keaton slammed a White House executive order temporarily suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, calling it \u201canother recruitment tool\u201d for Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThis administration creates Mayhem with no end in sight,\u201d Keaton said.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/09/30/michael-keaton-to-joe-biden-no-more-debates-you-won-walk-away/", "published": "2020-09-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Woodward: Trump \u2018Is Assassinating the Presidency\u2019", "text": "Veteran journalist Bob Woodward during Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC weighed in on the first presidential debate.\n\nAfter saying President Donald Trump had nothing new to say at the Tuesday debate and appeared to not even prepare for it, Woodward claimed he is \u201cassassinating the presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWinging it describes his presidency,\u201d Woodward argued. \u201cHe has not planned, he has not organized.

There was Biden saying, you know, half a dozen times, talking to the voter, saying, I\u2019m going to do this, I promise this, and so forth. Was it a perfect performance? No, but you\u2019ve got to put yourself in the place of somebody who has to actually go out and make a decision and who to vote for, and Trump is on a rant and rage.

The destruction set off a wave of nationwide riots that killed nearly 2,000 people.\n\nOn Wednesday, the judge said the demolition of the mosque was not premeditated and the evidence presented by law enforcement authorities was insufficient for convictions. During the nearly three-decade legal case, the charges were once dropped then restored, and a commission spent 17 years investigating the demolition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, India\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the destruction of the mosque was illegal but handed control of the site to a Hindu petitioner, paving the way for the construction of a grand new temple devoted to Lord Ram. Modi presided over the groundbreaking ceremony in August.\n\nThose acquitted Wednesday included L.K. Advani, a former deputy prime minister, who rode a chariot across the country to rally supporters to the cause of building a new temple to Lord Ram at the site of the mosque.

Each country will face more detailed audits in the coming months and years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPoland and Hungary came in for the toughest criticism, but the report also voiced concerns about corruption and the independence of the judiciary in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nOf those countries, all but Malta are formers members of the Communist bloc. But even countries with longer histories of democracy came in for some criticism: Austria, for example, was dinged for a lack of rules on how its government allocates its relatively high levels of state advertising to private media outlets.\n\nHungarian and Polish leaders both blasted the effort, saying they would found their own international rule-of-law institute to impose some counterprogramming on what they said was a biased message from E.U. headquarters in Brussels.\n\nAD\n\nOrban on Tuesday denounced Jourova for an interview she gave to Germany\u2019s Spiegel newsweekly last week. In it, she said: \u201cMr. Orban is fond of saying that he is establishing an illiberal democracy. I would say he is establishing an ill democracy. Criticism of the Hungarian government can hardly be found anymore in the Hungarian media, such that a large majority of Hungarians is likely no longer able to develop an independent view.\u201d\n\nThe Hungarian leader called her criticism a \u201cdirect political attack\u201d and demanded her resignation.\n\nInside Hungary, Orban critics said that even if European funding has enabled his rise, European criticism of him has also slowed some of his most far-reaching impulses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cE.U. institutions matter, and E.U. pressure matters,\u201d said Peter Kreko, executive director of Political Capital, a Budapest-based, politics-focused think tank. He said Wednesday\u2019s report could help rein in European leaders who have been damaging the rule of law.\n\nOrban last year abandoned an effort to create a new administrative court system after it raised concerns about judicial independence, for example, Kreko said. This year, the Hungarian leader handed back near-total emergency political powers that the Hungarian parliament rubber-stamped after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut E.U. money may be most important of all in shaping Orban\u2019s willingness to bend to Brussels, and sharp divisions remain within the European Union about cutting off funds to countries that violate E.U. rules on the rule of law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne reason for the stability of this regime is that it receives a huge amount of E.U. funds despite the fact that it ignores many of the fundamental values of the European Union,\u201d Kreko said.\n\nThe E.U. discussion about whether to tie European funding to rule-of-law issues will heat up in the coming weeks as negotiators intensify talks about the E.U. budget, the outline of which leaders approved in July. Some wealthy countries, including the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, have pushed for tougher conditions.

The situation has been made more complex by the intervention of Turkey, which, unlike previous flare-ups when it urged a cessation of hostilities, has staunchly backed Azerbaijan and is allegedly even engaging in the clashes. Armenian officials said a Turkish F-16 shot down an Armenian fighter jet, a charge Azerbaijani and Turkish officials rejected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore curiously, both Turkey and Armenia allege that the other side is importing mercenaries to the front lines. The Guardian reported that a group of Syrian fighters from Idlib province, the lone rebel-held bastion where Turkey holds considerable sway, were recruited in recent weeks to work for a private Turkish security company operating in Azerbaijan. According to the outlet\u2019s sources, as many as 20 such fighters may have been killed in fighting this week in the Caucasus.\n\nAnkara denies these claims and has wheeled around on Armenia, accusing the government in Yerevan of busing in Kurdish militiamen from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, to help train Armenian fighters in Nagorno-Karabakh. Whatever the veracity of these charges \u2014 and there are reasons to doubt them \u2014 they speak of a region riven with ethnic grievances and deep-seated political enmities.\n\nThey also point to a broader emerging phenomenon of mercenary outfits on the front lines of the 21st century\u2019s wars. Turkey, after all, established a template for enlisting Syrian fighters for its proxy wars when it transported hundreds to Libya to aid the government in Tripoli. Its apparent involvement in Azerbaijan adds to the conspicuous set of geopolitical confrontations initiated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, including entering the Libyan civil war; enabling the rebels\u2019 last stand in northwestern Syria; engaging in a tense maritime dispute in the eastern Mediterranean that\u2019s pulled in France and other European governments; and waging its long-running battles with Kurdish separatists operating along the borders of Syria and Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMost of the Syrian fighters in Libya have been hired by Turkey, which sponsors militias inside Syria opposed to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,\u201d my colleagues Kareem Fahim and Zakaria Zakaria reported earlier this year. \u201cTurkey also is the main military supporter of Libya\u2019s U.N.-recognized government, known as the Government of National Accord, or GNA.\u201d\n\nBut Ankara is hardly alone on this front. The Wagner Group, a Kremlin-linked Russian private security company, has deployed mercenaries over a wide spectrum of the world\u2019s battlefields, from eastern Ukraine to Syria and Libya. And, often with the financial support of the United Arab Emirates, Sudanese fighters have served as ground troops in civil wars in Yemen and Libya.\n\nMy colleagues reported that hundreds of Syrians aligned with the Assad regime and its Russian backers were also hired to support the rogue Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter, whose offensive against the GNA was successfully repelled with Turkish aid earlier this summer. A U.N. report this month tracked some 338 Russian military cargo flights from Syria to Libya in support of Wagner, operating on Hifter\u2019s behalf. The report said Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan were all violating a U.N. arms embargo on Libya by ferrying military equipment and supplies to the dueling sides in the conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinary Syrians have become pawns in this regional conflagration. \u201cAt a time when the Syrian economy and currency are collapsing, it is difficult for prospective fighters to pass up the generous financial packages offered for heading to Libya, offers that include salaries of $2,000 a month, a $500 advance for families left behind in Syria, and the promise of several thousand dollars in death benefits,\u201d my colleagues reported.\n\nHalf a decade ago, state collapse and economic hardship were seen as drivers for Islamist militants flocking to the chaos of the Syrian war. Now, some of these combatants are being funneled into new conflicts stirred by rival nation-states. The prevalence of Syrian fighters in places like Libya, argued Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, reflects \u201ca global trend toward the outsourcing of extraterritorial military force driven partly by the availability of itinerant, pay-for-hire fighters from failed revolutions and civil wars in Africa and the Middle East and the growth of private military companies.\u201d\n\nThese outfits may see this week\u2019s battles over Nagorno-Karabakh as a new opportunity. Russian officials have urged a cease-fire and cooling of tensions, but experts fear things could escalate as Turkey upsets a delicate balance of power. Ankara and Moscow could find themselves confronting each other in a third proxy conflict if Azerbaijani-Armenian clashes stray beyond Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf we see this conflict spill over into other parts of the geography \u2026 that will trigger a much more difficult episode between Turkey and Russia which will come on top of the existing theatres of conflict in Syria and Libya,\u201d Turkish analyst Sinan Ulgen told the Financial Times."}]}, "theonion": {"link": "http://www.theonion.com/", "articles": []}}}
